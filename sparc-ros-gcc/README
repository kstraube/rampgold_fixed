This package contains the cross-compiler for RAMP Gold, sparc-ros-gcc.  This
README file provides instructions on how to build and install sparc-ros-gcc.

This package has only been tested on CentOS 5 and Ubuntu 9.04. It is otherwise
unsupported.  On Ubuntu, it is necessary to install gawk before proceeding.
mawk is installed by default, and it will cause the build to fail.

To install sparc-ros-gcc:

1) cd tools/compilers/gcc-glibc

2) Edit Makelocal to set RAMP_INSTDIR to a suitable install location, not
   inside this source tree.

3) Add RAMP_INSTDIR/bin to your PATH.

4) Type "make ramp".

Make sure the compiler can correctly generate executables by creating a
simple C program and compiling it:

cat > helloworld.c <<'END'
 #include <stdio.h>
 int main() {
   puts("Hello, world!");
   return 0;
 }
END

sparc-ros-gcc -static -o helloworld -O2 helloworld.c

If the compiler executes without error, it is correctly installed.  Note
that it is necessary to use the -static flag; we do not support dynamic
linking.
