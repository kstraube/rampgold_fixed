Usage: find [-rtl|-tech] [-<object_type>] [-hier] [-namespace techview|netlist] [in <collection>] <pattern>
       [-regexp] [-nocase] [-flat] [-exact] [-filter <expression>]

    Creates a collection satisfying the specified constraints.
    Returns a unique identifier (a string like s:1426476) for accessing the collection.
    Use c_print s:1426476  or  c_list s:1426476  to see the contents.

    <object_type>: Specifies the type of object to be found: 
    <object_type> = view | port | instance | pin | net 

    -rtl:  Use the most recently activated RTL view or open a new one (default).
    -tech: Use the most recently activated Technology view or open a new one.

    -seq: Sequential (clocked) instances are found.  Option -inst is not needed.
    -hier: Conducts separate search starting from each module at and below the current module.
    -flat: Allows wildcard * to match the hierarchy separator.
    -namespace techview|netlist
        Modifies the scope of the Tech View search:
            techview:  Default: uses instance and net names from .srm file
            netlist:   Uses .sxr crossreference file to search for instance and net names in .vma file.
    -in <collection>   Searches inside a pre-defined collection to find a subset of the collection.

    <pattern> : Matches instance/net/port/symbols names against patterns, which can include the "*" and "?" wildcard characters.

    -hsc <separator> : override the default . character as the hierarchy separator in <pattern>
    -regexp:  Treats the pattern as a real regular expression rather than simple wildcard patterns.
    -exact:   Treats the "*" and "?" wildcard characters as normal characters. Mutually exclusive with -regexp and -nocase.
    -print:   Print results in TCL window.
    -nocase:  Ignore case in Verilog only. VHDL modules always ignore case.
    -help:    Prints this message

    -filter <expression>  MUST BE LAST OPTION TO FIND.
      Instructs find to filter objects based on their attributes.
      <expression>: @<prop_name>
      <expression>: @<prop_name> <rel_oper> <value>
      <expression>: (@<prop_name> <rel_oper> <value>) <logical_operator> (@<prop_name> <rel_oper> <value>)
      <rel_oper>: 	> < >= <= == != 
      <logical_operator>:	&& || ! 
	  Examples:
		find -hier -inst {*reg*} -filter @clock==CLK
		find -hier -net {*} -filter (@fanout > 4)
		find -inst *big* -filter (!@is_black_box && @pin_count > 10)
		find -seq * -in $all_inst_coll      Finds sequential instances inside all_inst_coll
		find -net * -regexp {[a-b].*}
		find -inst {reg[4]}    Use {} to protect patterns containing [] from TCL evaluation.
